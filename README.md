## Key Findings

- Weekly sales show strong periodic patterns across stores
- Holiday weeks did not always increase sales; impact varied by department
- Some stores consistently outperform others regardless of season
- Certain departments drive majority of revenue contribution

## Business Interpretation

The company should not rely on holidays alone for revenue spikes.
Store-level and department-level strategies matter more than seasonal events.
